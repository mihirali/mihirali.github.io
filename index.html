                Hi, my name is <b>Mihir Ali</b> and I am a third-year Electrical and Computer 
                Engineering major attending UT Austin. I am curently pursuing career
                opportunities in Software Engineering, and am particularly interested in 
                full-stack development.
            </p>
            <p class ="text">
                In terms of technical competencies, my preferred programming languages are Java and Python,
                but I also have experience with C++, C, and Assembly Language. I have experience using Git
                and GitHub for version control, and also HTML/CSS/JavaScript (currently learning React.js) for
                web development. I have also completed coursework covering core computer science topics such as:
                object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and software design and development under
                the Agile Scrum methodology.
